# Image-Editor

This is the final project for my CS 2810 - Computer Organization and Architecture - class. We built a very basic image editor in Java with LibGDX. It can't currently edit images in any capacity, but it does allow basic drawing and has functionality for buttons implemented as well, all of which is paving the way for the ability to mark up images in the future.
